# API Testing (Merlin blog)

This sample project contains API tests using jest and supertest, that performs few verifications of the OneMap public API

## Installation

You need to have `node` installed in your system. Install dependencies as follows:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run API tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## No guarantee
This project is not planned for maintenance. If any dependencies (including OneMap API endpoints) change, the project will need to be updated on your own.
